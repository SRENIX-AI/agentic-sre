### Diagnostics

| # | Category | Message |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `ExternalSecret` | ExternalSecret `b143e54c/289879e3` not Ready: error processing spec.data[0] (key: counsellor/config), err: Secret does not exist. Check Vault path / property names. Vault path `15d8e727/b79606fb` does not follow t6 hierarchy; expected: `2bb80d53/6374e63e/b143e54c/b79606fb`. |
| 2 | `missing-secret` | Secret `7f8e2ea7/97356135` does NOT exist (referenced by Deployment/openproject-cron in ns openproject, envFrom whole-secret import). Pod will fail to start on next restart. Create the Secret or remove the envFrom entry. |
| 3 | `missing-secret` | Secret `f3cc87f7/83e0fc4a` does NOT exist (referenced by Deployment/playground-agent in ns playground, envFrom whole-secret import). Pod will fail to start on next restart. Create the Secret or remove the envFrom entry. |
| 4 | `missing-key` | Secret `47c88e9e/73442ae4` exists but is missing key `github-token`b2a694ad/1124edcd`GITHUB_TOKEN` is a case/format variant — possible naming mismatch. |
| 5 | `unprovisioned` | Secret `7f8e2ea7/97356135` referenced by Deployment/openproject-cron has no ExternalSecret provisioning it. Create an ExternalSecret with spec.target.name=openproject-cron-environment pointing to Vault path `2bb80d53/6374e63e/7f8e2ea7/b79606fb`. |
| 6 | `unprovisioned` | Secret `f3cc87f7/83e0fc4a` referenced by Deployment/playground-agent has no ExternalSecret provisioning it. Create an ExternalSecret with spec.target.name=playground-agent-secrets pointing to Vault path `2bb80d53/6374e63e/f3cc87f7/b79606fb`. |
| 7 | `cert-expiry` | Certificate `25bf6a1d/9b6c2336` is not Ready: Issuing certificate as Secret does not exist. Check Issuer/ClusterIssuer status and cert-manager controller logs. |
