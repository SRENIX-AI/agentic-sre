# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file. The
format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

The Helm chart `cluster-health-autopilot` follows the same version line as the
`cha` binary (`appVersion == version`). Released chart artifacts are tagged
`cluster-health-autopilot-X.Y.Z`; the binary itself is tagged `vX.Y.Z`. The
published Helm repository at
`https://bionic-ai-solutions.github.io/cluster-health-autopilot/` always
serves the latest tagged chart cut.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `LICENSE-VERIFIED-LIBRARY.md` — formal terms for the paid Verified Signature Library subscription, replacing the placeholder reference in README.
- README section documenting the AWS cloud probes (RDS, EBS, EKS, IAM, ALB, ACM, KMS, S3, VPC) that were already shipping but undocumented.
- README link to `docs/READINESS.md` so prospects find the pilot-vs-production limits doc before the install step.
- `docs/AI_COST_MODEL.md` — failure-mode amplification section covering flapping-workload cost blowup, pre-Sprint-3 investigation rate-limiter gaps, and the worst-case planning table.
- `docs/design/2026-05-hardening-plan.md` — TDD-driven Sprint 0–4 plan closing the 2026-05-22 adversarial review.
- `internal/fix/gitops.go` — new public, kind-agnostic helpers `GitOpsReason()` and `IsPaused()` and `IsSuspended()` that any fixer can consult before mutating a resource. Lifts the private Ingress-only `isGitOpsManaged()` helper out of `tls_secret_mismatch.go` and broadens it to all kinds.
- Helm value `diagnose.backoffLimit` / `diagnose.activeDeadlineSeconds` (defaults 1 / 120s) and matching `remediation.backoffLimit` / `remediation.activeDeadlineSeconds` to cap CronJob retry storms.
- **Sprint 2 — six new probes** closing the most-impactful blind spots called out in the 2026-05-22 adversarial review:
  - `NodePressure` — surfaces DiskPressure / MemoryPressure / PIDPressure / NetworkUnavailable conditions the basic `Nodes` probe (which only checks `Ready`) misses. DiskPressure and NetworkUnavailable escalate to Critical; the others surface as Warning.
  - `DaemonSets` — checks DaemonSets in system namespaces (kube-system, cilium-system, calico-system, kube-flannel, rook-ceph, longhorn-system, openebs, metallb-system) so a broken CNI/CSI plugin shows up before nodes flip NotReady.
  - `PendingPods` — flags pods whose `PodScheduled` condition is False past a 60s grace window, with reason-aware remediation (Insufficient CPU/Memory, unbound PVC, taint mismatch, nodeSelector). Skips ImagePullBackOff (owned by the existing ImagePullAuth analyzer).
  - `CrashLoopBackOff` — generic crash-loop detector for any namespace, replacing the previous behavior where only workloads on the hardcoded critical list were caught. Severity scales: protected-namespace = Critical immediately; user namespaces = Warning until restart count exceeds the configurable threshold (default 10).
  - `ETCD` — watches the static-pod etcd members in `kube-system` (kubeadm convention) for Ready=False or restartCount>0. Honestly reports Warning ("probe is blind") when no in-cluster etcd is found rather than false-greening on managed control planes.
  - `FailedMounts` — joins Pods stuck in ContainerCreating past a 90s grace window with their kubelet `FailedMount` / `FailedAttachVolume` / `ProvisioningFailed` events to name the volume that's stuck and explain why.
- Configurable Services-probe targets via `CHA_CRITICAL_SERVICES` env var (semicolon-separated `ns/selector|Display` pairs) and the `cha.bionicaisolutions.com/probe-critical: "true"` annotation on any Deployment / StatefulSet. The compiled-in defaults remain the baseline; set `CHA_CRITICAL_SERVICES_REPLACE=true` to fully replace them.
- New `IsProtectedNamespace` helper in `internal/probe/` (duplicated from `internal/fix/protected.go` for package isolation; consolidation tracked under Sprint 5).
- `GVRDaemonSet` exposed by `internal/snapshot/` and wired into both `snapshot.CaptureGVRs` and the watcher's `watchedGVRs` so the new probe sees changes in real time and is captured by `cha snapshot capture`.
- Per-probe opt-out env vars: `CHA_PROBE_NODE_PRESSURE`, `CHA_PROBE_DAEMONSETS`, `CHA_PROBE_PENDING_PODS`, `CHA_PROBE_CRASHLOOP`, `CHA_PROBE_ETCD`, `CHA_PROBE_FAILED_MOUNTS` (set to `off` to silence individual probes without forking).

### Changed
- README architecture section now describes the actual Go-binary-on-distroless image and the three ClusterRoles (reader, remediator, driftreport) — the old description of a bash/jq/curl container and "two ClusterRoles" was inherited from a v0.x iteration.
- README and `docs/CHA_OVERVIEW.md` clarify that `VaultPathMissing` source code is Apache-2.0 OSS but ships unwired (you supply the Vault client); the paid CHA Enterprise binary auto-wires it.
- README roadmap section replaced the user-local path with links to `docs/design/`.
- `docs/FAILURE_MODES.md` analyzer count corrected from "seven" to "eight"; intro now distinguishes "source ships OSS" vs. "auto-wired in paid."

### Fixed
- **StuckRSPods** now refuses to `kubectl rollout restart` a Deployment that is GitOps-managed (Argo CD / Flux / Helm via `app.kubernetes.io/managed-by` or the per-controller annotations) or has `spec.paused=true`. Previously CHA would patch the restart annotation and the GitOps controller would revert it on the next reconcile, locking the two into a tight fight loop.
- **StuckJobsWithBadSecretRef** now fetches the parent CronJob and refuses to delete the broken Job when the CronJob has `spec.suspend=true` (an operator's deliberate freeze) or is GitOps-managed.
- **StaleErrorPods** now skips Failed pods that are either GitOps-annotated themselves or owned by a GitOps-managed Job. When the owning Job isn't in the captured snapshot the fixer falls back to today's cleanup behavior — orphan Failed pods remain garbage-collectable.
- **StuckCertificateRequests** now refuses to delete CRs when the cert-manager controller Deployment is captured in the snapshot and reports `readyReplicas=0`. cert-manager cannot recreate them in that state; the deletion would just nuke the diagnostic evidence without enabling retry.
- Helm chart CronJob Jobs now declare `backoffLimit: 1` (was K8s default 6) and `activeDeadlineSeconds: 120` (was unlimited) so a hung run cannot keep spawning pods for hours.

## [1.5.2] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Watcher now re-runs the Layer-2 investigator after fixers apply; the resulting investigation is reflected in the DriftReport CR.
- DriftReport CR severity and message refresh on update, not just on create.

## [1.5.1] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- Investigation field now persists on the DriftReport CR.

## [1.5.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Layer-2 Investigator: read-only deep-dive on CRITICAL findings.
- OSS ships a deterministic, rule-based investigator (TLS expiry, TLS SAN mismatch, DNS, slow-DNS, status mismatch, ExternalSecret, Certificate state).
- CHA-com paid binary swaps in an LLM-backed investigator via the same `Environment` interface.

## [1.4.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Probe flake suppression: retry + N-of-M streak gating before escalation to CRITICAL. Deterministic failures (TLS error, status mismatch) bypass the streak counter.

## [1.3.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- `TLSSecretMismatch` analyzer + opt-in fixer that repoints `Ingress.spec.tls[].secretName` to the cert-manager-managed Secret. Skips GitOps-managed Ingresses.

## [1.2.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Ingress host auto-discovery: every Ingress host in the cluster is probed externally by default.

### Removed
- `IngressCoverage` analyzer (replaced by auto-discovery).

## [1.1.0] — 2026-05-12

### Added
- Expanded default endpoint probe coverage.

## [1.0.0] — 2026-05-11

### Fixed
- AI-related Helm templates are now nil-safe for `--reuse-values` upgrades.

## [0.9.5] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- External endpoint probe.
- Ingress coverage analyzer (later superseded in 1.2.0).
- Rewritten `SETUP_GUIDE.md` for v0.9.5; corrected `NOTES.txt` template.

## [0.9.1] — 2026-05-08

### Added
- `StuckCertificateRequests` fixer: deletes terminal-failed cert-manager Certificate Requests so cert-manager re-issues.

## [0.9.0] — 2026-05-07

### Added
- `cha watch --live` event-driven watcher with Slack dedup (Phase 1).
